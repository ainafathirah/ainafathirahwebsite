<p>I am doing my Diploma practical for subject Library Fieldwork (IML 290) at PTAR UiTM Sungai Buloh. Together with my friends Umie and Nisha It cause us about 6 week to doing some library practical.</p>
<p>During the internship, I gain so much knowledge regarding how to handle the library users and the working process in the library. </p>
<p>The important part is my skills on communication to people have been upgraded for a good reasons.</p>
<p>Most of the library staff in PTAR UiTM Sungai Buloh treated me so nice and overwhelming. We shared some tips and funny stories while we are doing the work. </p>
<p>Hopefully I can visit them again.</p><p>&#128513;&#128519;&#128525</p>
